        <em>Paint Manhattan Circa 1799</em> is a web-based game to help players learn the history of Manhattan, as told by its streets.
      </p>
      <h2>Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Offline support!</strong> So you can always play in the subway or post-apocalypse.</li>
        <li><strong>Street stories!</strong> Most streets have a story associated with them, which you learn as you play. Some of these are humorous, while others are soul-crushing.</li>
        <li><strong>Sound!</strong> If you turn your speakers on, you will hear sound.</li>
        <!-- <li><strong>Obstinately artisanal!</strong> I am not very good at art but every pixel you see in this game was hand-crafted by yours truly.</li> -->
      </ul>
      <h2>Start playing</h2>
      <p>You can dive in here or learn <a href="#how-to-play">how to play</a> first.</p>
      <a href="game.html?narrative=on" class="game-mode">
        <h3>Normal mode</h3>
        <p>This is great for beginners, and introduces the streets in an order that roughly follows the history of New York City.</p>
      </a>
      <a href="game.html" class="game-mode">
        <h3>Hard mode</h3>
        <p>This mode randomizes the order of streets.</p>
      </a>
      <a href="game.html?noskel=on" class="game-mode">
        <h3>Nightmare mode</h3>
        <p>This mode removes the street grid, forcing you to paint with only the landmass as your guide.</p>
      </a>
      <h2 id="how-to-play">How to play</h2>
      <p>
        The game is played by &ldquo;painting&rdquo; the streets of the city: you are prompted with the name of a street to draw, which appears at the bottom-right corner of the screen. Drag your finger (or mouse) along the path of the street to paint it:
      </p>
      <img src="graphics/recordings/paint-recording.png" class="smaller">
      <p>
        Once you are done painting the street, you can release your finger, and will be given another street to paint.
      </p>
      <h2>But I don&rsquo;t know where any streets are!</h2>
      <p>
        It&rsquo;s fine if you don&rsquo;t know where a street is! In fact, beginners can just wave their finger or mouse all over the screen to reveal the street:
      </p>

      <p>
        You are free to play the game like this forever, or you can try to learn where each street is. At some point a game mode may be introduced to reward accuracy, but for now surgical precision is a self-imposed challenge.
      </p>
      <h2>God mode</h2>
      <p>
        This game doesn&rsquo;t really have a god mode, but it does have a <a href="debug.html">debug panel</a>, which can be used to create a custom game that plays your way.
      </p>
